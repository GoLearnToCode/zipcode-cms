# First Day Setup: Your Development Environment

You'll have to install three pieces of software in order to get ready for KIEI-924 this quarter.

- A **Web Browser** - We'll be using Google Chrome. I like Chrome for its fast and consistent performance, and its built-in Developer Tools (we'll be using these a lot).
- A **Code Editor** - The code editor is a piece of software that is used to create and edit text files. It's like Microsoft Word, but for code files instead of word processing documents. In this class, we'll use Sublime Text.
- The **Github App** - **Git** is a technology that professional developers use to store their code and share it with others. **Github** is a company that provides a popular hosted Git service. They provide an app for easy access to their service.

There's a also a short video to watch – it's recorded for Mac, but good for both Mac and Windows users to watch, just for a high-level overview.

Then, follow the below instructions for your platform.

# For Mac Users

Step 0! Make sure that your Mac is running Mac OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) or later. **If it isn't, please upgrade before continuing.**

### Download and Install Sublime Text

[Click here to get Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3). This is called the "Sublime 3 Beta", but it's been out for a long time and is very stable. Download the installer for OS X and run it.

It's free to try out, but after 30 days you'll start to get nagged to pay for it (which I'd recommend you do – it's $70).

Also don't miss the "unofficial" but excellent [documentation](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/index.html).

## Github

Sign up for a free Github account at [the Github website](https://github.com/). You'll be using your Github account for lots of things in class – including turning in your homework and tracking your attendance in class – so keep your account information handy at all times.

Once your Github account is created, you'll want to **enter your email address into your public profile**. Use the same address you used when you signed up for the workshop on EventBrite.  Do this by going to your settings (the little "cog" icon in the upper right) and entering it in the "Profile" section.

### Download and Install the Github App

https://mac.github.com/

Once installed, run the Github app. You'll be asked to enter the Github username and password you've just created, along with your name and email address. Once you've done this, you should be at an empty "Dashboard view", and you're all set.

# For Windows Users

Step 0! Make sure that your Windows PC is running Windows 7 or later. **If it isn't, please upgrade before continuing.**

### Download and Install Sublime Text

[Click here to get Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3). This is called the "Sublime 3 Beta", but it's been out for a long time and is very stable. Download the installer for Windows and run it.

It's free to try out, but after 30 days you'll start to get nagged to pay for it (which I'd recommend you do – it's $70).
