In case you haven't already, [follow the instructions to install all necessary development tools](/wilmington/workbook/setup).

Practice what we did together.  You should be able to:

1. Open the `profile/index.html` file in Sublime Text.
2. Make this page your own. Change each section so that the page describes something about you instead of good ol' Walter.  You don't need to provide too much detail.  The main thing is to just get practice at writing HTML content.
3. Make sure the browser tab displays a meaningful title (e.g. "About Me", "Brian's Resume", etc.)
4. Sync your code into your GitHub.com account. The repository should be named *(your Github username)*.github.io. For example, my Github username is *jeffcohen*, so my repository name for this assignment would be *jeffcohen.github.io*. This will automatically make your page available on the public Internet at that address (e.g. http://jeffcohen.github.io/).

Make sure you use at least all of these elements at least once:

* h1
* p
* ul
* li
* a
* h2
* body
* html
* title
* head
