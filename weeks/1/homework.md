In case you haven't already, [follow the instructions to install all necessary development tools](/wilmington/workbook/setup).

Practice what we did together.  You should be able to:

1. Get the example [profile](https://github.com/zipcode-wilmington/profile) repository if you don't have it already (use the Download Zip File button on the right-hand side of the page).
2. View the `index.html` file in your browser to see what it looks like.
2. Open the `index.html` file as source code using Sublime Text.
2. Make this page your own. Change each section so that the page describes something about you instead of good ol' Walter.  You don't need to provide too much detail.  The main thing is to just get practice at writing HTML content.
3. Make sure the browser tab displays a meaningful title (e.g. "About Me", "Brian's Resume", etc.)

Try to use at least these elements at least once:

* h1
* p
* ul
* li
* a
* h2
* body
* html
* title
* head
